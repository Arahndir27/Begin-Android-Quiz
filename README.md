# Begin-Android-Quiz

This is based on the GeoQuiz app made in the beginning of *Andoird Programming 4th Edition* by Big Nerd Ranch. I modified it to be Star Wars themed instead, because that is more fun. Obviously, I don't own or claim to have copyright with anything Star Wars related. This is just a fan app that I made to learn how to program Android apps.
